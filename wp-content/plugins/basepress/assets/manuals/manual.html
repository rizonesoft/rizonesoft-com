<h1>Manual</h1>
<p>Please follow the quick instruction below to get started using BasePress and build your knowledge base.<br>For further help please visit our <a href="https://codesavory.com" target="_blank">website</a> under <i>Knowledge Base > BasePress</i>.</p>
<h2>Set up the knowledge base entry page</h2>
<p>Before starting to use the Knowledge base you need to create a new standard page, set the title to 'Knowledge Base' (or any other name you want the knowledge base to be called) and publish the page.</p>
<p>After you have created the entry page you can add it to your menu of choice so your visitors can access it. For this go to Appearance > Menus and add the page to your menu.</p>
<p>Once the page and menu link are ready head to the settings page under <i>BasePress > Settings</i>.	In the General settings select the page you have just created from the select menu called 'Knowledge base page'.</p>
<h2>Choose Single or Multi Knowledge Bases</h2>
<p>BasePress was designed to work as a standard knowledge base or a multi one.<br>If you have a single product or service and you only need one knowledge base go to <i>BasePress > Settings</i> and under the General options select 'Single Knowledge Base mode'.
When used in 'Single Knowledge Base mode' BasePress will skip the entry page when people go to the knowledge base and the permalinks and breadcrumbs will not show the Knowledge Base name.<p>
<p>If you have more products or services and you want to create a different knowledge base for each of them leave the 'Single Knowledge Bases mode' option unselected.<p>
<h2>Choose the theme you want to use</h2>
<p>BasePress comes with some pre-made themes. You can choose the one you want to use under <i>BasePress > Settings > Appearance</i> along with some general aspect options.</p>
<p>If you didn't do it already save your settings.</p>
<h2>Start creating your content</h2>
<p>At this point you can start creating your content and build your knowledge base(s).<br>You should start by creating your first Knowledge Base under Knowledge Base > Manage KBs. You can add Knowledge Bases at any time and deselect the "Single Knowledge Bases mode" when ready.</p>
<p>Once you have your first Knowledge Base ready go to <i>Knowledge Base > Sections</i>. Select the Knowledge Base you have created in the select menu on the top of the screen and create your section(s).<br>
	Now that you have created your first Knowledge Base and section you can head to the knowledge base articles and create your content. Before publishing your articles remember to select the Knowledge Base and section the article belongs to.</p>
<p>You can now visit the front end of your website and click on the 'Knowledge base' link on your menu and you should see your content appear. Please remember that you need at least a Knowledge Base, a section and an article for the content to appear or you will just see an empty page.</p>
